#### Performance Optimizations
1. Implement Redis caching
2. Add database connection pooling
3. Optimize static file serving
4. Implement CDN for static assets
5. Add database query monitoring
6. Implement background task processing

#### Monitoring and Logging
1. Add application performance monitoring
2. Implement error tracking (Sentry)
3. Add user analytics
4. Implement health check endpoints
5. Add database performance monitoring
6. Configure log aggregation

#### Scalability Considerations
1. Implement horizontal scaling support
2. Add load balancer configuration
